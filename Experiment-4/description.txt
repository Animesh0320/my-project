This project is a lightweight web application that allows users to count characters in real-time as they type into a text box. It leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive and user-friendly experience.

HTML (Structure)
The webpage consists of a simple, well-organized layout:

Container <div>
Displays the page heading: “Live Character Counter”.
Provides a <textarea> (id=txtData) where users can enter text. It also uses a placeholder to guide new users.
Includes a <div> with the class counter that dynamically displays the current character count. A <span> element (id=counter) is updated in real time.

Script Section
Contains JavaScript for handling input events.
Listens to user keystrokes using the input event on the textarea.
On each keystroke, it retrieves the text length (textarea.value.length) and updates the counter display.

CSS (Styling)
The design is kept minimal yet clean to enhance usability:

Body
Uses the Arial, sans-serif font family.
Provides a margin of 10px for breathing space.

Textarea
Occupies the full width of the container (width: 100%).
Uses a larger, comfortable font size (18px).
Includes padding (10px) and box-sizing: border-box so borders and padding don’t break layout consistency.

Counter (.counter)
Styled for emphasis with font-weight: bold.
Adds a subtle margin-top: 5px for spacing.

Box (.box)
Enclosed with a 2px solid black border.
Includes padding: 10px for readability.
Adds margin-bottom: 20px between sections.
Restricts layout width with max-width: 500px, keeping design neat and focused.

Key Takeaways
Learned practical usage of JavaScript DOM manipulation by dynamically updating content.
Gained experience in handling real-time events with addEventListener.
Practiced integrating HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript interactivity into a cohesive web application.
